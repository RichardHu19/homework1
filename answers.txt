What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Git merge and rebase are used to integrate different branches. Git merge combines 
the two branches into one without changing the histories of the branches, whereas
rebase moves the start of the current branch to a later commit.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository stores versions of a project on a remote server, or the Internet.
